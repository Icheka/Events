# Events
EVENTS is a an events management/calendar web application written in PHP, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MySQL. This is the first time I am implementing Object-Oriented Programming on a large scale in both JavaScript and PHP at the same  time. When I finish this in a few days, I'll be confident enough to start learning both VueJS and Laravel -- two of the largest frameworks in JavaScript and PHP, respectively. I might also link the EVENTS app to my iPhone calculator clone (github.com/icheka/iphonecalculatorappclone) and even bring my Flue Notes (github.com/icheka/flue-notes) into it too.
